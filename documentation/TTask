Test Task

    Design a set of test cases for owner/permission/content modification testing of NFS4 file system.
    Implement designed test cases as testing application (test suite). E.g. all tests are stored in “tests” folder
    and there is “main” file which run all tests and produces an output.

The results of the task are:
    1. Test documentation. Use the following format:
        ○ Name of test case
        ○ Description
        ○ Steps
        ○ Expected result of each step
    2. Source code of test suite
    3. Logs of the latest successful tests execution

Test case example:
    Test name: Change file attributes to disable run, enable it , disable again. Description: test verifies that
    after several disable ,enable actions permissions set to last value.

Acceptance criteria:
    1. At least 8 test cases have to be created
    2. At least 2 test cases for ACL management verification (optional)
    3. Test documentation
    4. Use one of the following scripting language:
        a. Python (preferable)
        b. Ruby
        c. Perl (in OOP style)
    5. Test Suite has to prepare and clean environment
    6. Keep logs in log file. Short summary should be printed at the end of testing. E.g.:
        TC001: Passed
        TC002: Failed
        TC003: Passed
    7. Should be executable at any Linux-like system
    8. Please use comments in the code
